## âœ¨ My Thought Process âœ¨
```
Logic
```

* Given A number (to guess) - generated
* Create an array
* When user clicks button 
* We need to get user-input = guessedNumber
* Compare generated with guessed
* Generated is equal guessed
  * Notify that guess was correct. User wins.
* Generated is gt guessed
  * 'Too low'. Try again.
  * Add guess to array
  * Display prev guesses from array
  * Clear the input
* Generated is lt guessed
  * 'Too high'. Try again.
  * Add guess to array
  * Display prev guesses from array
  * Clear the input

```
UI
```

* Game Title
* place to show error/success message -> notification
* Notification -> to log our prev guesses
* Number input
* Button
